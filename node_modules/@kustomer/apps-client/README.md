# @kustomer/apps-client

[Documentation](https://developer.kustomer.com/kustomer-apps-platform/v0.1-Apps-SDK/docs/client-sdk-introduction)

The client SDK is a framework-agnostic library used to build client-side custom KViews within Kustomer server apps.

## Development

You can run the `yarn dev` command from the root of the repository to start developing.

The client simply inherits from the `common` package, allowing the ability to access common Kustomer API endpoints like running commands, getting kobjects, etc.
