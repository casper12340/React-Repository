# @kustomer/apps-common

The common package is responsible for hosting any classes, functions, or variables used by other packages within the Kustomer Apps SDK. It's primarily responsible for hosting the `API` class, which contains multiple subclasses, responsible for various calls to the Kustomer API. This API is exposed on the client as a singleton, like such:

```ts
const kapp = new KAppClient(...);

kapp.api.whatever_you_want();
```

... and on the server as a method that can be passed an org ID, like such:

```ts
const kapp = new KAppServer(...);

kapp.api(my_org_id).whatever_you_want();
```

## Development

You can run the `yarn dev` command from the root of the repository to start developing.
