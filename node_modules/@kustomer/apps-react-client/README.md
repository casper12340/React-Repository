# @kustomer/apps-react-client

[Documentation](https://developer.kustomer.com/kustomer-apps-platform/v0.1-Apps-SDK/docs/client-sdk-react)

The React library for building Kustomer apps wraps around the `client` library and includes useful components and state management features when building custom KViews in React.

## Development

You can run the `yarn dev` command from the root of the repository to start developing. You'll notice that the React client will also boot up [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for easy development of components.

You'll notice that this library inherits from the `tokens` package, which includes all theming tokens that are used in the construction of the React components. This allows us to have a single source of truth for component theming across the entire SDK, even if you're not using React.
