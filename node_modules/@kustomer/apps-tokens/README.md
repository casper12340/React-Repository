# @kustomer/apps-tokens

This package containing all styling and theming tokens for the Kustomer Apps SDK. Currently, they are only used in the `react` package, but they are available for use in any package and any client-side framework (such as Angular, Svelte, Vue, etc.).

## Development

_Be sure to include the Design Team in the review process when changing global theming code within this repo!_

You can run the `yarn dev` command from the root of the repository to start developing. You'll notice that the `react` package will also boot up [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for easy development of components, and allow you to change design tokens with hot reloading support so that you may see your changes immediately.
